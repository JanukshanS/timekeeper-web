## Overview

This is a library which is used to log the messages which you see to the console. This library is a direct wrapper around [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)
and is intended to make the logging process easier and at the same time facilitate tracing and debugging by injecting the **correlation id** to the logs and formatting them.

## Installation

<Installer library="@sliit-foss/module-logger" />

## Using Winston

You can access any of the winston modules as if you are accessing them directly from winston. <br/>

<Shell
  code={[
    'import { createLogger } from "@sliit-foss/module-logger";',
    "",
    "const logger = winston.createLogger({",
    "  transports: [",
    "    new winston.transports.Console(),",
    '    new winston.transports.File({ filename: "combined.log" })',
    "  ]",
    "});",
    "",
    'logger.info("Hello World");'
  ]}
/>
