## Clean Tracing

Functions provides 2 functions named **cleanTrace** and **cleanTraced** which behaves the same as **trace** and **traced** but ignores logging anything if the function
passed to it does not have a name whereas the **trace** and **traced** functions will log everything with the function name as **unnamed**.

This can be useful if the function which needs to be traced is passed at runtime and you want to prevent such scenarios from cluttering your logs.

This also is the mechanism which is used behind the scenes in the @sliit-foss/babel-plugin-transform-trace to facilitate clean tracing.

## Example

<Shell
  code={[
    'import { cleanTrace, cleanTraced } from "@sliit-foss/functions";',
    "",
    "cleanTrace(function () {",
    "  console.log(123);",
    "});",
    "",
    "const cleanTracedFn = cleanTraced(function () {",
    "  console.log(123);",
    "})();",
    "",
    "cleanTracedFn();"
  ]}
/>

The above code will not log anything to the console.
