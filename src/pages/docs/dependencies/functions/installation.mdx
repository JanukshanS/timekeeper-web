Functions also exposes a few other modules which however are not required by timekeeper. For a full list of modules exposed by functions and their usage,
please refer to the [examples provided](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sliit-foss/functions?activeTab=readme). Here are however, a high level overview of the functions available.

## Modules

- **bindKey** - Creates a bounded function from a passed object and function key with its context preserved.

  - This method is **distint from the bindKey function of lodash** as this **preserves the function's name** property where lodash sets it as **wrapper**.

- **cached** - Creates a cached function that memoizes the result of the passed function. It makes uses of the [express-http-context](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-http-context)
  to maintain the cache. This cache is specific to a single request.
