## Trace A Function

Used to trace the execution of a function then and there.

<Shell
  code={['import { trace } from "@sliit-foss/functions";', "", "trace(function foo() {", "  console.log(123);", "});"]}
/>

The above code produces the following log in the console.

<Shell code={["foo execution initiated", "123", "foo execution completed - execution_time : 0.2069999985396862"]} />

## Decorators

Used to create a traceable function by passing it your original function.

<Shell
  code={[
    'import { traced } from "@sliit-foss/functions";',
    "",
    "const tracedFoo = traced(function foo() {",
    "  console.log(123);",
    "})();",
    "",
    "tracedFoo();"
  ]}
/>

The above code produces the same output log as the previous example.

You can pass in arguments to the traced function in the same way as you would to the original function.
